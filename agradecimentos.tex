			While we have tried to tell the story of the development of Real Analysis as completely as possible, our overriding goal was always to teach mathematics, not history. Thus we have necessarily left the history incomplete.%
			\par
			The interested student can fill in the gaps we have left by making use of the extensive resources that can be found at the \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/}{MacTutor}\footnote{\nolinkurl{mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk}\label{g:fn:idp4}} history of mathematics repository.%
			\par
			All of the portraits of mathematicians used in this text have been taken from MacTutor.%
			\par
			MacTutor was created, and is maintained by Professor Edmund Robertson (Emeritus), and Professor John O'Connor (Emeritus), both of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.%
